Structs

Structs:
    - Short for structures
    - Are value types that are typically used to encapsulate small groups of related variables
    - Best used for small data structures that have value semantics and will not be modified after creation.
    - Examples include: 
        - Complex numbers
        - Points in a coordinate system
        - RGB colors
        - etc.
    - If you need inheritance, polymorphism, or large data structure, classes are typically more appropriate.
    - Structs are similar to classes but have some important differences.

Key differences between Structs and Classes:
    Value Type:
        - Structs are value types, which means they are stores on the stack (or inline in containing types) and not on the heap
        - This generally makes them more efficient in terms of memory allocation and access speed compared to classes
          which are reference type and stored on the heap.
    No Inheritance:
        - Structs do not support inheritance, which means they cannot be used as a base class for other structs or classes.
        - However, structs can inherit from interfaces.
